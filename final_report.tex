\subsection{AJAX web applications \cite{mtr08}}
AJAX is a technology that can be used to develop Rich Internet Applications.
Since it use assynchronous messages between client and server and it allows dynamic page alteration in a different way than the multipage Web paradigm, it introduces new chalenges to the testing of these web applications.

\subsubsection{Techniques}
In the paper, four Web application testing techniques are introduced: \emph{model-based}, \emph{code-coverage-based}, \emph{black box} -- three tradicional Web applications testing techniques -- and \emph{state-based} -- this last one proposed as more adequate to handle with AJAX applications.

\paragraph{Model-based testing}

is a \emph{white box} testing technique.
A model of the application is constructed using reverse engineering and Web crawling technique -- a program that automatically transverses the Web's hyperlink structure, retrieving the content of the Web pages.
It generates a graph where the nodes represent pages and edges represent links.
The test cases will be defined chosing a coverage criteria and applying to this model. 

\paragraph{Code-coverage-based testing} 

is another \emph{white box} testing technique. 
It uses a control flow model of the application where nodes represent statements execute by the Web server or by the client and edges represent control transfer.
Theoretically, it can be use to test a AJAX Web application, but due to the complexity and dynamism of AJAX Web pages, this technique is very limited for this use.

\paragraph{Black box testing} 

uses functional requirements of the application to define test cases, i.e., scenarios that can be accomplished by a Web visitor through the browser.

\paragraph{State-based testing}

is proposed by the autors of the paper as a more efficient way of test a AJAX Web application.

Using AJAX, the state of the elements in the client-side can change dynamically.
A \emph{state} is considered a possible instance of the DOM in a Web page, i.e., it's characterized by the HTML elements.

A finite state machine describes the the behavior of the Web page, containing the states (equivalence classes can be used to reduce the total number of states) and the transitions, related to methods triggered by GUI events -- interations with the user, like button clicks -- and \emph{callback} functions -- tht happen when the page receive a response from ther server.

The method consists in: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{FSM construcion}. The FSM that models a AJAX Web page an be constructed during the design phase or can be reverse enginnered from the code.
\item \emph{Path extraction}. One coverage criteria (states or transitions coverage) is chosen and the paths are extracted from the FSM according to it.
\item \emph{Test cases generation}. Each path is converted into a test case.
\item \emph{Test cases execution}. A tool that works in HTTP request-response level is used execute the test. cases
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Experiments}

The experiment consists in use the four testing techniques introduced to test two diffentent Web applications composed of Java, JSP and Javascript code -- \emph{Photoshare} and \emph{theOrganizer}.

\paragraph{Preparation and procedure}

To test the \emph{effectiveness} of each technique, and the \emph{effort} demanded by them, faults are injected in the code of both applications (seven faults in \emph{Photoshare} and nine in \emph{theOrganizer}).
These faults try to simulate bugs commonly found in real applications and are introduced by a person different than the tester.

For each testing technique, a suite of test cases is defined.
This test cases suites are applied using following metrics:

\begin{itemize}

\item To test \emph{effectiveness}:
\begin{itemize}
\item number of faults revealed;
\item number of use cases exercised;
\item severity of faults -- the person who injected the faults determine each one as \emph{severe} or \emph{not severe} according to the potential tha it has to crash the system;
\item number of faults with high degree of relation with AJAX technology.
\end{itemize}

\item To test \emph{effort}:
\begin{itemize}
\item number of test cases in the suite;
\item complexity of the whole suite;
\item time needed (\emph{man-hours}) to prepate the testing environment.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Results and conclusion}

The \emph{state-based} and the \emph{blak box} techniques found thirteen faults each, and were the better techniques in this criterion.
However all the techniques seens to be complementary, since they find different errors in the systems.

As expected, the \emph{black box} technique is the one that covered more use cases, but not the whole set.
It covers 91\% of the total of use cases.

Eight of the total number of fault were considered \emph{severe}. Again, \emph{black box} testing and \emph{state-based} testing had the better results, finding 75\% of the \emph{severe} faults each.

There were eight \emph{AJAX related} faults among the total number of errors. 
\emph{State-based} testing found 75\% of these bugs, and was the better than the other techniques in this metric.

It's possible to conclude that the traditional techniques and \emph{state-based} testing are complementaries.
The \emph{state-based} testing is more likely to find errors related to AJAX, other techniques will work better with other kind of errors.

The \emph{state-based} testing is not the technique with the largest test cases suite (it has 78 test cases, against 111 of the \emph{code-coverage-based}, 93 of the \emph{black box} and 61 of the \emph{model-based}).
However it had the test suite with the biggest complexity in average and by far the technique that demands more time of preparation of the testing environment.

Summing up, although the \emph{state-based} testing technique demands a effort bigger than the traditional testing techniques, only it can reveal some faults related to the AJAX technology, due to be the only one that focuses it.
The traditional techniques, nevertheless can be used as complement to the proposed one, since they found errors that are difficult to find using \emph{state-based} testing.
